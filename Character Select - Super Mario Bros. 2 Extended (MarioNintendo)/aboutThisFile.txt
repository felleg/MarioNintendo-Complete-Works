Remember that old saying? "Quitting rhythm games is impossible"?

Well, you better believe it. Quitting this game is indeed impossible! Even though I officially retired from stepping songs in 2019, there will always be a part of my brain that wants to step every cool song I hear. Unfortunately for my retirement, I stumbled upon this gem of a song by Shnabubula: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dygKwk09hY (The video is as amazing as the song, check it out!). Actually, I started stepping the song 2 months after originally seeing the video... because I had forgotten about it initially and ended up watching it again randomly. I told T-Force to attempt to step it, and then I felt this pit in my stomach; this song was mine to step!

I had to pull all the stops to step this one: re-install DDReamStudio. Re-install StepMania. Re-install Etterna. Struggle with beat placements because Shnabubula is a mad scientist. Re-experience the neck pain from an instense stepping session. It was a joy. Shnabubula is my muse. I stepped this during my summer vacation from work over 3 days (I finished it on August 29 2021). I like what I ended up with! 

I hope this chart will make you discover a sweet remix of a classic Nintendo song from my youth. To be honest, I think this is a one-off, as I have no plans to start stepping regularly again. :-) It was a nice trip down memory lane for me.

Love you all, and thanks for playing!
