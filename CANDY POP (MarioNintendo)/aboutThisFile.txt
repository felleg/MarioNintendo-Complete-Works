Nostalgia overload for me.

I created this file in the summer, I want to say of 2009. I was my first "big" project to which I devoted a
lot of time. I had discovered the song in this video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIvv4aja5K4
The video was featured on Youtube's front page at the time. It was a big deal! It had far more views than the
actual counter shows nowadays.

I remember coming back from school and booting up my Windows XP computer just to focus a bit more on the file.
I don't know what made me want to step it: I knew nothing of Haruhi Suzumiya at the time (I'm not really into
anime). The song wasn't techno-ish. But, for some reason, it stuck with me. Maybe because of the background
video, which is so hypnotizing?

Believe it or not, I messaged the author of the video, Koopiskeva, to ask him formal persmission to include
his video in the background for my Stepmania song. He said yes! It's sad that Youtube's messages don't work
anymore, otherwise I would have copied the message here.

Well, there's nothing more to say. Enjoy this dusty file. It's an oldie, but a goodie. It just wants to warm
your heart. :)
