"8-bit" song from Nick Perrin! I stepped this in 2010, back when the Dragons Fury forum existed. I really
wanted this song to make it into FFR, but it never came to be. The file is not perfect, but it has a neat
nostalgic feel. The song itself is good... Man, Nick Perrin makes too much good stuff. He's incredible.
