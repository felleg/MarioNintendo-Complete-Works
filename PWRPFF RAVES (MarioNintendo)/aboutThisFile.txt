My 36th file on FFR.

As I wrote in the `aboutThisFile.txt` of La Fuite Des Jours, I have been a long time fan of music from Cranky.
I'm all about those old school DDR-esque beats. When I first heard PWRPFF RAVES, this was a match made in
heaven for me (this was right when the Powerpuff Girls craze hit FFR in 2011 or 2012, where everyone and their
dogs had Powerpuff avatars for some reason. Sky Kitten still has hers as of this writing). When reading the
old batch reviews on FFR, I noticed that someone did try to send it prior to 2010. Thankfully for me, it got
rejected, which gave me a chance to submit my own version! Unfortunately, my first attempt was unsuccesful,
since my version initially got rejected as well. Undeterred, I tried once more, and finally succeeded. It took
a long time, but the dream came true! Enjoy.
