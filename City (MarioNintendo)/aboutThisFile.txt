A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

When I was growing up, one of my friends owned a Super Nintendo (I was "stuck" with an NES and a Sega Genesis.
Hard to complain!). The Super Nintendo felt so alien to me. He had this Power Rangers game, which kicked all
sorts of ass. This song is the song of the first level. I stuck with me for a long, LONG time. 

Many years later, I finally got my own Super Nintendo and immediately snatched the game on eBay to relive the
old memories. The game is as good as I had remembered, if not a tad monotonous :P But the music? Man, this
stuff is timeless. I hope you'll like the chart I made.
