My 19th file on FFR.

I'm super sad about this song because I'll probably never get to play it outside of Stepmania, it being a skill token. I don't even remember how to unlock it, but I know I gave up on it a long ago. The song is all about old school charts, with fast stream patterns and clean layering. Good stuff! It's also a classical file, which makes it all the better. Too bad it's hidden so far away... :( By the way, this is the first song by Y.W in the game, even though you probably didn't know it!
