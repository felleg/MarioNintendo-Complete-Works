My 16th file on FFR, but do not let that fool you...

This is actually the second song I stepped to send to FFR. It was first stepped in Stepmania... and that's the
reason why it took so long for it to be released. While the sync was impressive for being fully made out of
Stepmania (the BPMs vary so much through this piece!), it really wasn't good enough to make the cut. I put the
project on hold for a year and, when I finally got to open it in DDReam to tweak a few things here and there
and finally make the PR right, the project came full circle. I think this song almost matches the Animus
Intorqueo ones, but I'll mostly remember it as one of my oldest files (the oldest one being Nocturne Ab Min
No. 2 by Nick Perrin, unreleased as of this writing). I also like its difficulty. :)
