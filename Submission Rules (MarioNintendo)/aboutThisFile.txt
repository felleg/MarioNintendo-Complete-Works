My seventh file on FFR.

This song caused such a stir, omfg rofl. It all started with this thread:

As a new user to FFR in 2008, back when the simfile database still existed (take that, admins!), I had a
really hard time understanding how the selection process for simfiles worked on FFR. Maybe it was because the
default viewing option for threads on the forums was REVERSE, which confused the living shit out of me until I
realized that you could reverse it like two years later, but, for whatever reason, I didn't get it, even when
I was on the very page that explained how to send files to FFR. I then thought of a way that players who were
confused like me would realize that there are indeed real guidelines as to how to send stuff to the site if
you wanted too: singing those guidelines and making it into a simfile. At the same time, it was also a way for
me to test with how much I could get away with when sending files, and it was a lame excuse to add the "FFR R1
music producer" under my username. As a side note, kommisar gave it a perfect score, so SUCK IT. XD
