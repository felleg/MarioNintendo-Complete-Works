My 20th file on FFR!

This song is legendary to me.

I first heard it through this flash on Newgrounds: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/307813 (youtube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBYQpgAA5A). I instantly fell in love with it. To be perfectly honest with
you, I always wanted this song to be in FFR, from the moment I first logged in in 2008. When I was thinking
about stepping music for FFR, this is exactly the song that came to my mind. I guess I connect so much with
this song because it's exactly the kind of music I wish I was ably to play on piano.

I think the reason it took so long to get it in is the fact that the author of the song, jackie1188, was so
hard to contact. I had to use the internet archive to see his lost German blog which was linked to his
Newgrounds account, and fiddle around to find a contact page, to notice he had a youtube account called
paradoxonmusic. His last login at the time was 2 years ago. I dropped him a PM expecting nothing, and a month
later I got a positive response. His name is Andreas Kuch, and he is a brilliant (timid) musician. Anyway, I
tried to step this song with utmost respect after all this time it took me to contact the guy. I think it
shows in the final simfile. I will always have a great time playing this and I really think this is one of my
most underrated songs.
