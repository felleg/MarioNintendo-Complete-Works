My 1st file on FFR.

Wow, this takes me back. This was when I discovered what dubstep was (thanks to Elite_Ninja who introduced me
indirectly to xKore back when he was still unknown on Newgrounds) and how to work DDReamStudio (thanks to
Wayward Vagabond, who I cannot thank enough for urging me to stop using Stepmania to step my files). Since I
didn't know how the inner workings of DDReam worked, I started thinking unconventionally, and eventually came
up with the "red-accelerating-arrows-of-doom". It proved to be quite a success with the judges and, quite
frankly, the song is so catchy that I can't help but coming back to this song once in a while. Trivia: I had
to PM xKore himself for the actual name of the song. The official title is "Xkur Top Secret Preview!!!!!!!",
since no final version of the song has been released. 

PS: I WAS THE FIRST ONE IN ALL OF FFR TO STEP XKORE MUSIC.
