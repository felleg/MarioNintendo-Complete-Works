I was a big fan of Jon Lajoie back in the days. The voice sample was taken from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wS5xOZ7Rq8
Can you believe that the guy in the video saying "I don't give a fuck" is a homeless guy I later had the
pleasure of meeting every day when getting off my train on the way to college? :P It felt surreal.

I made the song in garageband, if you care. The song is meant to play with fail off, or autoplay, because some
passages are just..... nasty. Sorry! Early file :) Back then, I thought it was more about the spectacle than
actually playing the file. Ah, the innocence of youth.
