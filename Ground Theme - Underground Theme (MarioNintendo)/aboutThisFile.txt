A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

The first file I stepped from the Super Smash Brothers Wii U OST. It was the beginning of a great string of
songs... :)

The Challenge chart was stepped first, with the heavy chart added later as requested by macgravel.
