A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

The song for the first level of the 2D Shoot 'em up called Verytex. Very cool composition for the Sega
Genesis. Had you heard about it before? My goal was to share it with the world. The chart is just a bonus.
Enjoy!
