I was required to come back from the grave (and retirement).

After stepping the first 140 seconds of this song (https://shnabubula.bandcamp.com/track/racing-back-to-earth), I can't take any more. It's not that the song is bad: it's that I can't tell if I'm doing a terrible job at it. The mix of trills and polyrhythms is making my brain melt. I have no idea if I'm overdoing it. Opening DDReamStudio makes me a bit anxious. Can't have that!

Instead of throwing the file away, I thought I might as well make a thread about it on FFR to see if someone would like to pick it up, run with it and call it a collab. Heck, I would be willing to playtest whatever chart that person would come up with! And if, in the end, no one is interested in turning this wip into a finished product, I suppose that means it wasn't worth it.
