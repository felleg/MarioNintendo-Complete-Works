"I know, I know. This song is a mess. It was meant to be. H-hey, put down those rocks, okay? You're going to hurt somebo- OUCH!!"

Hey there, MarioNintendo speaking/writing. Thanks for downloading this song! Yeah, it sucks, but I tried to make it entertaining to watch. :-D

Here's where you can contact me to scream out loud about how much you hate it:

I stepped this by using DDReamstudio (for beginners out there who would like to get a bit serious about stepping, this is the tool you are craving for!):

The background and banner for this song were (supposed to be) made by Shikari (as I am writing this, they don't even exist yet), whom you can reach here:

Take care guys, and stop playing dumpfiles, they hurt your brain. :-)
