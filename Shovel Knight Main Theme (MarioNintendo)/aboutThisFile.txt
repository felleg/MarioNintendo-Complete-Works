A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

Shovel Knight Main Theme. I threw this together and somehow it got accepted in VGMP4. Hi19hi19 must be
fuming... He also wanted to step the song, but seeing I submitted something, he decided not to submit his
version. I don't know if he stepped/released a full version of his own. If he did, his version is probably
more interesting than mine. To be honest, my version of Shovel Knight Main Theme was submitted to VGMP4 back
when the pack was somewhat dormant, so I didn't expect much out of it.

I guess it's just one of those instances where I got lucky! Because of that whole story I'm not entirely sure
how I feel about the chart: there are blatantly copy/pasted parts, and it was made on auto pilot. I hope
you'll enjoy it. If not, I hope you enjoyed learning a bit more about its history!
