My 27th file on FFR.

I always liked Kil songs. I don't understand how the guy can be so secretive about himself, but whatever. His songs are overkill. Gaussian blur series? Wow. Toph OP? Genius! Do A Barrel Roll? omfg. Gameboy Rave? Goddamn Jesus. So even though the guy was long departed from FFR, I took it upon myself to step a Kil song. I had just found out his Youtube channel thanks to Kommisar's help, where the bastard kept on uploading miraculous songs one after another like it was nothing. I took his best and gave it a good step. I tried to keep a retro feel to match the fact that Kil files are associated with the golden age of FFR and Stepmania. I hope it shows. I absolutely adore this one.
