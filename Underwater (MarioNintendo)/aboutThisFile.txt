A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

Another Shnabubula classic. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but as I said in Alien Lair, Area A
and Temple, this song is very special to me. It feels like the culmination of a lot of years of learning how
to properly make songs. It's not perfect (that's why it's not on FFR: it got rejected), but goddamn this chart
is exciting (to me)!

I hope you'll dig it as much as I do.
