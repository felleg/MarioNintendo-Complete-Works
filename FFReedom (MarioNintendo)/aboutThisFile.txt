I believe I stepped this around 2008, I lost the original date. My goal was to create a song (in garageband)
and step it. Simple as that! This, in theory, would enable me to create exactly the patterns I wanted. I
wished so much to have it into FlashFlashRevolution that I named it FFReedom. I submitted it to a bunch of
Stepmania packs, but it always got rejected. So I guess this is a file no one really cares for, but it's
special to me! I let my creativity flow a lot in this one :) Try it out, who knows, it's cute.
