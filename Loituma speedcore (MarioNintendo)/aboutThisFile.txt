Some file I created for the FFR Simfile database, back when it still existed. 2008. A great year for
MarioNintendo as a stepartist, many firsts!

At the time, I didn't know the original name of the song was Pretty Green Onions, and not Loituma Speedcore.
On youtube, everyone called this song Loituma Speedcore for some reason. Different era!

I remember sending it to a user called JajaDiddles (or something like that) to tell me if he liked the song.
He was a player that I faced in FFR multiplayer, who was much better than me. He (understandably) found the
song kind of lackluster.

But hey, it's one of my first files. Take it for what it is :)
