A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

Why did I step this song?

Because I want you to play the 2D shoot 'em up Mecha Ritz: Steel Rondo. The game is on Steam, and it's great.
It you like Sega Genesis shmups, you have to check this game out.

Especially its rocking soundtrack!
