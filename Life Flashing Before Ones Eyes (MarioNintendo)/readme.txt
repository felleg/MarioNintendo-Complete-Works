Hey!
MarioNintendo here, just to let you know that the only reason I stepped this song is because I want you to check out its game, Mecha Ritz: Steel Rondo.
It recently came out on Steam (May 16 2016). It's a shmup, basically a fusion between Recca (Famicom) and Battle Garegga.

I found this game by accident and it totally took me by surprise. You won't regret trying it out!
