A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

I love Eternal Champions on the Sega Genesis. This song, Blade's stage, has to be my favorite in the entire
game. It's just so intense, and at the same time, so... cool! I love the sound used for "guitars" in the song.
I had wanted to create a step chart for the song for a long time, and the Video Game MegaPack 4 was the
perfect motivator.
