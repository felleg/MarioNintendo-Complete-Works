The last complete file for keyboard that I made. This is (so far) the culmination of 10 years of evolution.
Wow, this sounds more dramatic than it really is...

I gave it my all for this song. The song was meant for the Piano Minipack of Elegance 2, shortly after I took
leadership of the pack. I wanted to step a song from Art Tatum, and this fit the bill perfectly.

This song is so complex it almost sounds like two people are playing at the same time. Believe it or not,
there's only a single player playing all these notes. The video is on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exgEAT4h3oc

I had a great run stepping all these files over the years. It's quite fitting that my last true file is a
piano chart. I always had a weak spot for those... Well, thanks for all the memories.
