My 38th file on file on FFR.

When downloading Scintill's first minipack on Stepmania, I discovered Shnabubula's music. Upon exploring
Shnab's library of music, I stumbled upon NES Jams, an album that mixes chiptune with piano improvisation. In
short, I wanted to step ALL 11 songs from the album, which is a rare feat. I actually ended up stepping 4 of
them, which I am quite proud of. I think this is my favorite of the bunch. Like the Alien Lair and Underwater,
this file was stepped while I was at a conference in Switzerland, jetlagged out of my mind. I couldn't sleep
at 4am, so what better way to pass time than to step a song you love? Enjoy!
