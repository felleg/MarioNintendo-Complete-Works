My 29th file on FFR.

Celldweller has had songs on FFR since 2003, if I recall. Still, it had been a long time since we had any song from his released, and I really liked this one. The weird dubstep it had, the whole feel was really nice. I thought it could be my second Automata. It probably wasn't as good as Automata was for its time, but it's a decent one. Too bad I stepped it so short, I should've left the whole ending :(
