Hello, thank you for playing this file! :)
This song is from the game Raystorm, developped by Taito. It is in fact an arrangement of the song that plays during the credits.
The soundtrack for this game can be found here: http://vgmdb.net/album/684 I highly recommend you check it out!

The creation of this Stepmania chart would not have been possible without DDReamStudio. If you have never
heard about this tool, or if you are looking for an alternative to the standard Stepmania editor, check out
this awesome guide: http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?p=3672495
I left the .ds and .dsx files I used to make this chart in this folder. Open the .ds with DDReamStudio and voila!
You will be able to look at how I crafted it :)

I also included the original version of this song (Ceramic Heart) because I just found it too good. Consider it a easter egg,
and a thank you for taking the time to read this. Enjoy!
