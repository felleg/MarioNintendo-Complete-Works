A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

As a video game collector, I really love to discover more underground games. I adore 2D shoot-em-ups, for
their fast-paced action. One day, I found out about RayForce/Galactic Attack/Gunlock/Layer Section. Awful
name(s), but TERRIFIC game.

And then I heard the credits music for the first time... It was beautiful! It contained so many emotions. I
can hear it in my head right now as I'm typing this, it fits a certain mood of closure, finality.

By some unknown chance, I discovered this orchestral remix of the song from an OST disc of the
game. I just had to step it, out of my love for the game, to make players of Video Game MegaPack 4 aware of
the game's existence.

Take a deep breath, and enjoy this song.
