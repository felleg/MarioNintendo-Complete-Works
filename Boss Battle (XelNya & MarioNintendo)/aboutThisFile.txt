A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4. WITH XELNYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

XelNya (aka Midnight, aka xX{Midnight}xx or some weird shit like that) had been a friend since the Dragons
Fury days (~2010). It felt good to finally step a song with him. I have to give Xel kudos, he had a hard time
making songs at the beginning, but nowadays he can make great songs effortlessly. It was great to work with
you, man! :)
