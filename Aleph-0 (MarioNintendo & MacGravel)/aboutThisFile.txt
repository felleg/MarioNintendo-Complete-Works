This file was meant to be stepped with Macgravel, for the "Macgravel and friends" pack. Sadly it didn't make
the cut.

The goal was to make a pad file.

Yeah... I'm not good at making pad files. I tend to underestimate the difficulty a bit!

If you play this in xmod, you'll see all the cool negative BPM tricks implemented by macgravel. This is black
magic to me, and I think it looks really cool :)
