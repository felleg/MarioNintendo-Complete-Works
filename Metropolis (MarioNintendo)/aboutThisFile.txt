This is an ooooooold file of mine, never submitted anywhere. I believe I stepped this in the same summer as
Candypop, which makes me want to say around 2009.I hope you will enjoy this artifact. I still can't believe no
one stepped it on FFR. It feels like a Mega Man song through and through... I love it! The chart shows its
age, though.
