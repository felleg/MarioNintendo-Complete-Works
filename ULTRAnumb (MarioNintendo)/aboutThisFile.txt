My 24th file on FFR.

Blue Stahli. This band has millions of views on Youtube, yet no one had stepped a song from them at that point
in time. I thought it would make me famous if I stepped their most popular song...... Turns out, Silvuh gave
it a perfect score, but I don't remember anyone telling me they had played it. lol! It's nothing exceptionnal,
to say the least, but hey, it was a decent attempt at stepping mainstream music. :)
