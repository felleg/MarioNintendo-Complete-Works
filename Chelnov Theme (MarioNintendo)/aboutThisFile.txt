A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

Atomic Runner Chelnov is among my top 2 favorite games of all time (the other being Rocket Knight
Adventures). I selfishly stepped this song just because I wanted more players to know about this game.

In Atomic Runner, you are Chelnov. The game plays like a blend of 2D shoot 'em up with Mario Brothers. The
graphics are absolutely stunning for the Sega Genesis. The challenge is just right. The music and scenery is
varied... I recommend you check it out!! :)
