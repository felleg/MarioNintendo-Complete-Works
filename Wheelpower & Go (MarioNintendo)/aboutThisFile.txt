This file was created for a Stepping tournament on FlashFlashRevolution where participants stepped the same song. Judges would select their favorite submission and reject others. Sadly, this submission was not popular, but I truly did give it my all at the time.

If I remember correctly, the first prize for the tournament (which was sponsored by FFR, it was quite a big deal) was $100 and a pair of Beats headphones. The one who won the tournament was ilikexd.
