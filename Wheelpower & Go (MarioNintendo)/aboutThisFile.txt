This file was created for a Stepping tournament on FlashFlashRevolution where participants stepped the same
song. Judges would select their favorite submission and reject others. Sadly, this submission was not popular,
but I truly did give it my all at the time.

If I remember correctly, the first prize for the tournament (which was sponsored by FFR, it was quite a big
deal) was $100 and a pair of Beats headphones. The winner of the tournament was ilikexd.

I stepped this song in my friend's basement during Saint-Jean Baptiste. My friends were playing NHL on PS3 and 
I just wouldn't have any of that crap! Rhythm games forever, woo! (I'm a freaking nerd ;_;)
