My third file on FFR

This is when I started discovering Nick Perrin's music on Newgrounds. I was in shock; this music was exactly
the kind of music I was looking for. It was diverse, inventive and, especially, fresh. Comfortably Lost was my
first foray in the "jazz" genre and is a testament to how much I love stepping drums over anything else, rofl.
As I'm writing this in 2013, it doesn't feel as good as I remember, but I still get a fuzzy feeling when I
see this file.
