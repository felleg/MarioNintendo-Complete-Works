My 25th file on FFR.

In my neverending pursuit to step music that would attract every single players, me not knowing which song is currently looked upon by those very players, I stepped a very emotional burst of nostalgia: the theme of aeris. The mp3 quality is bad and it took me two tries to get it accepted, something I did not expect at all, and it's, in the end, a really flat song. You might enjoy it if you're really beginning to play FFR, but, other than that, there isn't much to this one. :P
