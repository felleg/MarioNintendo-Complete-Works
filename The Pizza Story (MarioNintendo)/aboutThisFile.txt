This song was created in 2012 as part of [midnghtraver](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/profile/midnghtraver/)'s thread [Lets make a rap song about pizza](https://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?t=125238).

The chart was created on June 12 at 23h30 using a combination of
DDReamStudio and Etterna on my Steam Deck. Playtesting was hard because
I don't know how to reset the damn cache in Etterna. Gaaah-d damnit!

The background art was created than none other than Hateandhatred using
A.I. with the prompt "realistic ginger man, wearing a hatsune miku
shirt, wearing girl panties on his head, panicking on the phone while
his pizza bursting in flames". Nailed it.
