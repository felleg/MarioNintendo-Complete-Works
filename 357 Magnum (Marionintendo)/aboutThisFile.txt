My 13th file on FFR.

In that point in time, I had 11 songs in game. The judges definitely knew who I was, but I didn't feel the
players themselves were really playing my files at all (except for Automata, which I got an amazing feedback
from). I then started thinking that I had to step intense japanese-touhou-muzie shit like oster project (when
she doesn't do jazz) or xi to interest players in my files. After a quick listen to both artists, I decided to
opt for xi with this particular file. It was my hardest file at the time and I guess it came out pretty well.
Not being a really good player myself, I always try to make the file more fun than technical. On that special
occasion, I think I managed to have a good balance between both. Oh, and, also, since the name of the song
begins with a dot, it's at the top of the "all songs" list, so every player sees it before clicking on another
song, which is good advertisement for me! Smart move, MN. ;) Side note: Originally, this song had a ton of
hands, but I felt it didn't really match the old school "this song is so japanese" feel of it, so I removed
them. That means that this song has quads, but no hands. rofl!
