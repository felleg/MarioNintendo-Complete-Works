My 30th file on FFR.

I had recently discovered Waterflame, an awesome fellow on Newgrounds who creates music that sounds like old
Sonic games. I got hooked. That's my favorite kind of music. -Slapstick- really reminded me of Jet Grind
Radio, and I thought it would make a good entry to Waterflame to out little game. I think it's a solid one,
and that you should give it a try again! :D
