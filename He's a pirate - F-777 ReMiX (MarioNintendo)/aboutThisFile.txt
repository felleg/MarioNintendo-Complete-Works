This file was meant for FFR, but unfortunately was never accepted. It almost made it, though. In the 2010 song
batch submission on FFR, megamon88 stepped a version of this same song, that got accepted. In the next batch,
I also sent the same song, without knowing about megamon88's version in the release queue (otherwise, I would
have not bothered).  Jimerax said he preferred my version, but ultimately my version was dropped in favor of
megamon's. I think it's fair: it takes months, sometimes years for songs to make it into FFR. It probably
would have made him pretty sad if my song replaced his version.

I hope you will enjoy this different version. :)
