A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

A cool funky song from Mario Kart 7. I had a hard time getting the layering right on this one, but I did my
best. One of the last songs I sent to the VGMP 4.
