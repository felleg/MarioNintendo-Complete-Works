My 37th file on FFR.

One of my absolutely favorite FFR file is probably Witches' Hat (for a full year, it was my alarm to wake up),
performed by Orange Dust and stepped by Patashu. Because of this, I wanted for a long time to step a file from
Orange Dust myself. Them beats are so strange yet groovy, it's electrifying. I found his soundcloud and
noticed this was one of his last songs before retiring from music, so I jumped on it immediately and tried to
step it as faithfully as I could.
