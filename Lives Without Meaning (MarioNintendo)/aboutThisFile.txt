My fourth file on FFR.

This song is so, so good and I love this chart so, so much. Justin_ator told me it was his favorite to AAA,
and I have to agree with him; the chart came out (in my opinion) as a timeless one. It's not a hard file at
all, but it really has a heavy feel which makes the percussions stand out in a fantastic way. I also always
liked the idea of having pitch relevancy for drums, so this was my attempt with this song. It was the first
Clonepa song in all of FFR, too! Take that, OWA!
