My 28th file on FFR. I think.

Now this one has a weird history. I first heard this song when I played The Incredible Machine 3 (TIM3) on my
PC at the age of 5. It's an old Sierra puzzle game, still one of the best. It has fantastic midi music, and,
among those, this very song. Since I played it at such a young age, I always thought the people of Sierra had
composed it themselves, but turns out, it really was an older song than I thought. I gave a listen to the
orchestral version on Youtube and was shocked by its beauty. The rest is history! Forgettable chart, but damn
fine song.
