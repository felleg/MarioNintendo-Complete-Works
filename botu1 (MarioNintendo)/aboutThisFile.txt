My 1nd file on FFR.

 I saw someone (Silvuh? dore? I don't remember) mention on the forums that stepping an easier chart was harder
 than stepping a hard chart, as you have to know precisely what arrow goes to what and to make decisions in
 your layering. I was then tempted to verify that. botu1 was a sweet song from 44teru-k who didn't have any
 files in at the time, and I just wanted to verify if that statement in the forums was true. Turns out, it
 really wasn't (lol), but I'm still glad with how that file came out.
