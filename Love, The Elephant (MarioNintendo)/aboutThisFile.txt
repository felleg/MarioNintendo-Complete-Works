My fifth file on FFR.

When I got permission from Starship Amazing to step their songs (this band is made of the Happy Video Game
Nerd and his friend Calvin who are pretty popular on Youtube), I was ecstatic. I immediately wanted to have
the first chart of this band in the game. I took what I considered at the time their most steppable songs and
just ran with it. Turns out, no one really played that file and it's a really forgettable chart, but I like
its retro easy-going 2003 style feel. :)
