The second file from xKore I stepped. The rhythms are really weird. Play it in xmod if you dare, it's cool to
learn the rhythms by heart. On cmod, the file loses a lot of its charm. It gets really stressful to see the
arrows pulsating at various frequencies.

This file was included FFR Community Pack of Summer 2011:

Sadly, it never made it into FFR. All the red arrows looked too bad, according to the judges!
