This file was stepped during Anime North 2018. It is my first true pad file. And oh boy, I totally
underestimated the difficulty, there's no way in hell I can pass this!

I was made aware of this song when Sanzath sent it my way. You see, I live in Quebec, and Anime North happens
in Toronto. To get there, we have to embark on a huge road trip. Naturally, road trips are better with
soundtracks! I started this tradition in 2014 and we have made soundtracks every year ever since.

I stepped a major part of this chart in a hotel room at the Anime North 2018 convention in Toronto with
XxOpkillerxX playtesting the chart on the bare floor (thank god it was all carpet). He gave a few suggestions
(one of which was a nasty foot-switch), but unfortunately I think not enough of them are left in the chart to
count this as a collaboration regarding the naming scheme of Stepmania song folders. Still, XxOpkillerxX
deserves a shoutout in this about file, so cheers to you, my friend!

This song was too good not to be stepped. I ended up spending at least a good quarter of the convention on
this file. It was really exciting. I even have videos of people trying it out:

Enjoy! Don't be ashamed if you play the file with a keyboard. :)

P.S. The original chart from 2014 had a few mistakes that bugged me, I tried to iron them out with this 2022
version.
