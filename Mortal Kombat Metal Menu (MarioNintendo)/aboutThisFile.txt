My 8th file on FFR.

There weren't any Mortal Kombat songs in the game, and this song was really good! Turns out I always wanted to step rock (maybe for the percussions...), so, whaddaya know, it all came together pretty quickly. Not a timeless one by my standards, but hey, I guess it's pretty fun!
