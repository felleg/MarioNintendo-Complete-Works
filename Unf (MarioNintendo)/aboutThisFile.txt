This was a file meant for FlashFlashRevolution that unfortunately was never accepted. When stepping this, I
tried to use the same tricks as when stepping Automata. Automata was hugely popular with the FFR's judges at
the time. They were impressed with the way I stepped the beats that increased and decreased in speed ("red
arrows"). The way this trick was achieved was by simply putting a beat on every occuring note in DDReamStudio:
the speedups and slow-downs happened naturally. However, this effect fails in Unf because there are no
speedups or slow-downs. Therefore, the effect of the red arrows falls completely flat!

I still enjoy this song for what it is: a picture of me trying to replicate a past success, and failing. I
learned an important lesson in the process.

What does the song name stand for? "Unfinished"? Weird. :)
