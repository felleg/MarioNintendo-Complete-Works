My 22th file on FFR.

This is the song that took me the longest to step. I had read this random post on SulferDragon's profile and
totally agreed; someone had to step this beast. It was meant to be a collab between me and Shikari, since we
talked together a lot on Dragon's Fury forums at the time. I stepped half of it probably in 2011, and left the
other half for him to step (when I say half, I really mean 50%, as I stepped here and there but not a whole
half). Turns out, the guy really wasn't interested at all in stepping, so I left the project on hiatus for a
long time. I tried to finish it by myself, but I couldn't get the layering right even if I tried my best, it
being almost an 8 minutes song. A year later, after playing many of megamon88's files, I started to realize he
had the kind of vision I needed in charts. His name also worked with the song I wanted to step. So I contacted
him, and it got finished pretty quick. The dude is pretty sweet, and I'm totally satisfied with the result.
This song is one hell of a marathon, but, if you can handle it, you'll be greated with some of the most
rewarding melodies ever conceived! Plus the steps are nice so that's a plus for sure. XD
