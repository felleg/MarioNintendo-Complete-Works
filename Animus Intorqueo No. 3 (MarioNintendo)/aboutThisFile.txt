My 9th, 10th and 11th files on FFR, respectively.

In my opinion, the Animus Intorqueo series of files will always stand as my grand masterpiece. My greatest
contribution to the FFR community?  Whereas Rebirth0 has his The Games We Played in 5 parts, I have those
three Animus Intorqueos by Nick Perrin.  In 2011, the year when they were stepped, I was really into
impressionnist music. I tried to learn Liebestraume no. 3 and Clair de Lune for piano, and so I really fell in
love with Animus Intorqueo as soon as I heard it. These are the first songs I stepped in DDReamStudio, right
after having stepped In Flux on Stepmania. The new software created a world of difference and made those chart
possible. It took me a lot of tries to get the layering and PR just right (hence why it got released in 2012),
but I think they're pretty much perfect simfiles by my standards. They even inspired me to post the official
DDReam guide on the forums!  xP All kidding aside, I really feel these three files represent my style
simfile-wise and I definitely think you should play them again, if you haven't yet.


NOTE: This was written in 2013. As of 2019, I do not consider these files to be masterpieces anymore, but they
were definitely an important stepping stone for me. I look back on them fondly.
