My 21th file on ffr (?), honestly I'm starting to lose count.

Originally, this song was called "bwshitennou" on Y.W.'s site. Not noticing it was a Pok√©mon boss battle song,
I stepped it because it had "shit" in the title and it made me laugh. Yeah, I'm an idiot. This song is great,
though, and, while I probably didn't provide it with the best chart (I was just stepping it because it had
"shit" in the title, remember), I think it's a decent challenge and a good warm up if you need it. Just don't
expect anything groundbreaking!
