A legendary file.

When I first saw videos of really difficult stepmania songs (from this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE-zKztQkUQ), I immediately thought: "I want to top this". There was the 960
BPM song floating around, which was pretty hard... so naturally, I created a song at 1111 BPM! Always going
one step further. But it would last only about 3 seconds (or 5, really)...

Here is the first time this file was unleashed to the world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4C2FhJ2sBA

A monster was born then.
Soon, The Time Warp, Jungle, and many more would follow... F8 minipack of doom!
