My 15th file on FFR.

I stepped this song in a single day. Literally, I made a hi19hi19 out of myself: I heard the song for the
first time, thought: "wow, that is really steppable!" and farted out a simfile in the afternoon. Maybe I
should have cut the song later, because we don't get a lot of wub-wubs for our money's worth, but what you get
is still a great dose of fun. :)
