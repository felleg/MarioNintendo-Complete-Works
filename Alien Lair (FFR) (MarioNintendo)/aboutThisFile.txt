The last file I created for keyboard as of this writing. Which means probably the last file I worked on with
FFR in mind. :'(

This is a special version of the Alien Lair file stepped for the official FFR tournament. When I tried to
submit the version of Alien Lair from Video Game MegaPack 4 on FFR, the judges gave some feedback on things I
needed to address, which ended up changing the song significantly. Here it is for you to enjoy!

At the time of writing, there's a bit of drama in the air relating to the 12th FFR official tournament and its
files, so I'm not sure if this file will ever be featured on the site or not. Either way, here it is, and I
hope you will enjoy.
