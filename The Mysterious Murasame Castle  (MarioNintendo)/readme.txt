A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

Breakdown of the difficulties:
Light: For new players interested in Stepmania and who were enthusiastic enough to download this pack. This difficulty might be too hard for new players, but keep trying and you will succeed!
Heavy: The main file (at least for me) for this song. This is the first version I stepped.
Challenge: This file is very similar to the heavy file, but has a few mini-jackhammers thrown into it.

Possibly my least favorite file in the VGMP4 pack. Thanks for playing it, though! :)
