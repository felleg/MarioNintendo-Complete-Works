A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

A song from the Super Smash Bros Wii U. I always forget about this one, for some reason. I might have went a
bit overboard with the holds, but I gave it a good shot.
