## Note about CD-titles
You will generally find two CD titles in this pack. They useful to distinguish my older files from my newer
files.

### Original CD title
![](mntitle.png)
This CD title is the original CD title I made for myself in Microsoft Paint, back in 2008 (or was it 2007?).
If there's one thing you will notice, is that even after all these years, I still use Paint for just about
everything.

I have used this CD title from 2008 to 2012. At that time, I was mostly making simfiles for myself, since I
did not know how to get them accepted into the FFR R1 engine (see the song named Submission Rules). I am very
nostalgic towards these files, but even I will admit they are often bad and/or awkward. In 2012, ScylaX made
me a new CD title. I also implemented the newer CD title in my "modern" files from 2010 to 2012.

### Current CD title
![](mntitle.png)
On September 24 2012, ![ScylaX](http://flashflashrevolution.com/profile/ScylaX) rocked my world by creating a
brand new CD title for me. My request was the following:

```
How about a Super Mario 8-bit head with thin black outline 
and my username right under it in small cool stylish blocky 8-bit outlined freecam100% text?

(I feel like I'm 12)
```
The resulting CD title: ![](mntitle.png)

This was pretty much exactly the CD title I craved. I have been using the CD title ever since to identify my
"modern" files. I consider my modern files to start in Q4 2010, meaning everything created after (and
including) `Nocturne Ab Min No 2`.

Enjoy!
