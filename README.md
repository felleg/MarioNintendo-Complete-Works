Note about CD-titles
====================

You will generally find two CD titles in this pack. They are useful to distinguish my older files from my newer
files.

Original CD title
-----------------

![](og-mntitle.png)
This CD title is the original CD title I made for myself in Microsoft Paint, back in 2008.
If there's one thing you should notice, it's that even after all these years, I still use Paint for just about
everything.

I have used this CD title from 2008 to 2012. Its file name was `!udderTitle.png` because I had copied the file
structure from a file I had downloaded on the FFR Simfile Database (Udderdude's {Rose} Remastered). I had not
realized that "udder" in the filename referred to someone else's username, and so I lugged that CD title around
with no second thought! Pretty much no one knew about the existence of this CD title,
because I never submitted songs to public packs at the time. I made the songs available as downloads in the
description of my YouTube videos. At that time, I was mostly making simfiles for myself, since I did not know
how to get them accepted into the FFR R1 engine (see the song named Submission Rules). I am very nostalgic
towards these files, but even I will admit they are often bad and/or awkward. In 2012, ScylaX made me a new CD
title.

Current CD title
----------------

![](mntitle.png)
On September 24 2012, [ScylaX](http://flashflashrevolution.com/profile/ScylaX) rocked my world by creating a
brand new CD title for me. My request was the following:

```
How about a Super Mario 8-bit head with thin black outline
and my username right under it in small cool stylish blocky 8-bit outlined freecam100% text?

(I feel like I'm 12)
```

Even though my wording was garbage, ScylaX understood and managed to deliver pretty much exactly the CD title
I craved. I have been using this CD title ever since to identify my "modern" files. I consider my modern files
to start in Q4 2010, meaning everything created after (and including) `Nocturne Ab Min No 2`.

Files not included in this pack
======================================

## Undertale Songs

I have created an Undertale troll pack which is downloadable [here](https://www.stepmania.com/forums/song-packs/show/5564) ([mirror](https://gitlab.com/felleg/undertale-pack)). The goal was to make fun of the tsunami of fan-content surrounding Undertale.  I still have tremendous love for the game: it really helped me get through 2015. However, I was not a fan of its fandom.

Interestingly, it is (by far) my most downloaded work: 47,000 downloads on MediaFire as of 2021/07/19. I don't get it.

In comparison, the "F8 Minipack of Doom" (of which all files are included in this Complete Works archive) has 618 downloads.
The Complete Works archive (which I poured my soul into) has 358 downloads.

Thus, because my Undertale troll pack is already my most downloaded work (and also a complete waste of time), I have chosen to leave it out of this archive.
