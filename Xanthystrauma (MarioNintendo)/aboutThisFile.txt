My 17th file on FFR.

I stepped this song for two reasons: firstly, I had just discovered scylaax who had released his song album on the forums (really great stuff on there! check it out!) and I really wanted to be the first one to get him into the FFR music producer circle. Secondly, I was so disgusted (read: jealous) by the amount of talent some players had that I really wanted to make an un-AAA-able file just to troll with them. Turns out, some players use this file as a workout, and, worse yet, some players have been dedicated enough to AAA it. Damn. Congrats. I can't even FC it, and I have a hard time barely PASSING it on stepmania! Side note, the earlier version was supposed to be even harder, sadly (thankfully) it was deemed too ridiculous by the judges.
