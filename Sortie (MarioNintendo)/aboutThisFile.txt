A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

This is one of the greatest songs on the Sega Genesis, from Gauntlet 4. I love stepping more underground video
game music. This is definitely one of them. Oldie, but goodie, from the legendary developer M2.
