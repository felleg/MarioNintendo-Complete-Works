My 34th file on FFR.

I had always wanted to step a song by Cranky. I remember going on his muzie page and scrolling through the
songs... They were all so good for stepping, it amazed me! The problem was that most of them were already
stepped by someone else on FFR, since they were pretty old. It took me a long time to step this one (if I
remember correctly, I worked on it for about a year), but I hope the wait paid off. :)
