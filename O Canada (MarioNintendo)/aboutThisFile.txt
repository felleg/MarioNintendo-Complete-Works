This song was recorded from my cellphone on the road to Anime North 2014. Singing the song are Hateandhatred and me. The fart noises you hear in the background were playing on the car's radio (it was a song from our roadtrip playlist that Hateandhatred kept repeating. He played it on repeat for 2 hours, I kid you not.) It was the first time Team Quebec got together. Magical times were had. It is tradition for us to sing this as loud as we can in our van/car. We couldn't believe our eyes when a random player posted a score on FFR for this song... "You mean there are some people that play this shit even if they're not in on the joke?!" Apparently, yes. I hope this text clears things up for you if you were wondering. :)


p.s. The background of the background is from the song She's Got Moxie, a song stepped by DDReamStudio's creator to demo his program. Check out http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?p=3672495
