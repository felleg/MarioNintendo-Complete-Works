A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

This is the first file I stepped when I saw submissions opening for Video Game MegaPack 4. This song, Magical
Sound Shower, is a classic. I first heard it when playing Shenmue II on the original Xbox, around 2004. I
could not believe no one else stepped it in the course of the three previous Video Game MegaPacks. I just had
to do it...

To my complete shock, the file won the "Best File" award for the pack. It's true! See for yourself! I can't
believe it either! http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?t=145418

I swear I didn't pay the judges!! :P

I hope you will find I did the song justice. Cheers!
