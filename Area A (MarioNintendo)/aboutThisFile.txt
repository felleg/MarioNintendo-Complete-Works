This is a Shnabubula file that, surprisingly, was not stepped for Video Game MegaPack 4. This is because,
after stepping 31 files for VGMP4, and ran out of gas and had to take a breather.

Area A was stepped more slowly with no clue where it would end up. I eventually sent it to Kommisar's Xoon
Legacy pack, where it got accepted.

Files like this one really show how far I've come since 2008, both as a player and as a stepper. I am very
proud of the jumpstream patterns featured in this file. Jumpstream is something I struggled with for the
longest time, so it felt very liberating to be able to step such patterns! I hope you will enjoy it. :)
