My 33rd file on FFR.

Believe it or not, had been wanting to step this file since summer 2012. It was the same time I had stepped the (soon to be infamous) Xanthystrauma. I feel these two files were some of the most steppable material Scylaax had at that time, and I'm really happy that my version was included in the game. I hope I made a worthy chart, since the song is really interesting in my opinion!
