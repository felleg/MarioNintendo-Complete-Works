My 33rd file on FFR.

Believe it or not, had been wanting to step this file since summer 2012. It was the same time I had stepped
the (soon to be infamous) Xanthystrauma. Accelerator was completed years later, however, because I was never
fully satisfied with the chart. 

In the end, I felt these two files were some of the most steppable material Scylaax had at that time, and I'm
really happy that my version was included in the game. I hope I made a worthy chart, since the song is really
interesting in my opinion!
