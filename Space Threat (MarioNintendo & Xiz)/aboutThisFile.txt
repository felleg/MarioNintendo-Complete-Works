A collab between Xiz and I that unfortunately got rejected for FlashFlashRevolution :(
And we both kind of forgot about it. Xiz likes to step wub-wubs. He's cool. Check out his stuff!

p.s. I put my CD title on that song because I don't have a CD title for "MarioNintendo & Xiz" at hand, but
this was an actual collab. Hope you won't mind, Xiz!
