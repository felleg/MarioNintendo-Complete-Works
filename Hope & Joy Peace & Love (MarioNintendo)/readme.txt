I think it's a beautiful song. I cry every time. It reminds me of the happy memories I had with Konami, and how the company really went downhill these days. 
Who knows. Maybe in the future they actually get back on their feet and start kicking ass once more!... But I doubt it. If anything, they'll probably go hang out with Hudson Soft.
