My 26th file on FFR.

GOD, now this is painful. This is currently the song at the end of the skill chain tokens on FFR. This means that, whatever the efforts, I will probably never get to play this song either, just like S. The saddest part? Aside from Animus Intorqueo, this is my other masterpiece. While Animus is a pure classical piano file, this one a pure arcade rock file, and it just plays like a Scintill file (read: fantastic file). It's really worth your time to unlock. Too bad I'll never get to play it myself. :'( I had to PM bmah to ask him NOT to step it, because I knew it was his kind of songs. lol, thanks for not breaking your promise man. :3
