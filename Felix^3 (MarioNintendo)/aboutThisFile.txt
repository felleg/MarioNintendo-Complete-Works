My 32nd file on FFR.

This was stepped before A Crimson Rose and a Gin Tonic and was meant to be released before it. It's a tricky
file. Stepped it for its appealing name. haha. x)

Weird note about SessileNomad, this user won the FFR contest for the new FlashFlashRevolution theme song. His
song was 45 seconds long, and I forgot what it sounded like... Funnily enough, the not FlashFlashRevolution
engine did not even use his song: the menu was totally mute! I wonder what SessileNomad thought of all this, poor
fellow!
