My sixth file on FFR.

It was a war between me and bmah. We both wanted to step this one. The solution? Stepping it together! I
remember sending him a pm telling him something akin to "PLEASE, I really really want to work on this file, if
you want to step it at least let me help". I must have sounded really desperate, but he was nice enough to
grant my wish. Thanks, bmah!

I think it ended up being a nice blend of our styles, with his methodic layering and my rigid PR. It was
released as a tournament file, which I guess made a few people rage (I can't AAA this one for the sake of my
life)! Still, a wonderful piece by katoh, which inspired me to step more stuff from him in the future (see car
select). I come back to this one from time to time and I always enjoy myself. An underrated gem! :)

Fun note: When the guitar plays fast 24ths streams, it wasn't always stepped that way. Bmah insisted the notes
were going faster than 24ths, and so they were charted as 32nds (or something like that) for the longest time.
I disagreed, but I felt somehow he had to be right, since he was, after all, bmah.  It wasn't until just the
day before the song's official release that bmah played the file and realized the rhythm error, and so we
hurried a very quick patch just in time for the tournament release. Psychoangel691 was not pleased with this,
to say the least, but we made it just in time. Phew!
