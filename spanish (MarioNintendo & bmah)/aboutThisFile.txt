My sixth file on FFR.

It was a war between me and bmah. We both wanted to step this one. The solution? Stepping it together! I think it was a nice blend of our styles, with his methodic layering and my rigid PR. It was released as a tournament file, which I guess made a few people rage (I can't AAA this one for the sake of my life)! Still, a wonderful piece by katoh, which inspired me to step more stuff from him in the future (see car select). I come back to this one from time to time and I always enjoy myself. An underrated gem! :)
