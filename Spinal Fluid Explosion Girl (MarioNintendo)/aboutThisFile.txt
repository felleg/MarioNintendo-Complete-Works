This file was created for a Stepping tournament on FlashFlashRevolution where participants stepped the same
song. Judges would select their favorite submission and reject others. Sadly, this submission was not popular,
but I truly did give it my all at the time.

If I remember correctly, the first prize for the tournament (which was sponsored by FFR, it was quite a big
deal) was $100 and a pair of Beats headphones. The one who won the tournament was ilikexd. Because of this, he
is now known as the best stepper on Earth. And he's got sweet new heaphones! Congrats :D
