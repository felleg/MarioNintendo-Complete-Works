A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

I love Dynamite Headdy, but the game is so freaking hard. I never made it to the final boss without cheating.

When I heard the boss's music for the first time, I found it mesmerizing. Had to give it a shot! When
Macgravel received it for the VGMP4 pack, he was so happy with it that he gave it the special treatment:
background animations! You need to play with Stepmania 5 / Etterna with backgrounds on to see it, but it's
there!

Enjoy :)
