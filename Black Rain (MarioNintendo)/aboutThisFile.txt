A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

I had always wanted to step a S.S.H. song. I always liked songs from Technosoft. And then, one day, I
discovered on Youtube that S.S.H. had made a remix of a song from Technosoft. I had to step it!

Black Rain is a song featured in Hyper Duel, an incredibly expensive 2D shoot 'em up for the Sega Saturn. I
doubt anyone played this game as a kid in America. The song is cool, though, and that solo is wicked! I hope
you will enjoy it. :)
