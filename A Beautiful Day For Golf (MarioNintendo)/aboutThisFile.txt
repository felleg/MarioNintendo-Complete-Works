A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

With this file, I had a few goald in mind. Create a few difficulties, sure. Give Neo Turf Masters some
well-deserved love, yep. Showcase the wonderful intro in .avi form, check!

But the thing I wanted most... was for the file to be the first to appear in alphabetical order. :o And I'll
let you in on a little secret... Since this song doesn't have an official title, I made it up...

buT HEy ItS a beaUuuuTifuL daY FoR GOLF! :D
