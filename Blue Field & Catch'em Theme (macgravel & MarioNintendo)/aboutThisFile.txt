A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

After sending a bunch of files to Macgravel for the VGMP4, he basically got in touch with me asking "Who are
you? You weren't around back in 2008, where did you come from?". I was quite happy to tell him that his packs
were one of the major reasons I picked up Stepmania and started stepping. It was a nice moment!

After a bit of talk, Mac proposed this song, Blue Field & Catch'em Theme, for stepping together. It was great
working with Mac, a great honor I will not forget anytime soon! Kind of like meeting the hero you never knew
you had, and realizing that meeting your heroes is not always as bad as people say. :)
