A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

A goofy song from the Super Smash Bros for Wii U soundtrack. At the time of stepping, the song was available
nowhere else than on the soundtrack. That's because the stage where this song played (Miiverse) had not yet
been released! :D It was an awesome feeling to step a "hidden" Super Smash Bros. song.
