My 31st file on FFR.

Yes. Holy shit yes. Yessssss, in fact! I first heard of this song from the Video Game Megapacks on Stepmania, it was stepped by Yessssss. One of his best charts, that bastard. I always liked it. When I discovered that YMCK made a version of this song, which had bleeps and boops and that we had permission for it, I immediately took a dive in. I didn't want anyone else to nab it. It only took me......... a year to step it. Call it lack of time or motivation, I couldn't finish the damn thing. Maybe it's because I really intended it to be my final song. I had to give it my all in June of this summer to end it. Upon finishing this beast, I knew I had something special in my hands. It got the highest ratings in the batch it was. Talk about ending on a high note! At this state, I don't know if I'll ever step again, but one thing is for certain. When this song gets released, I think you people will be most pleased with what you will see. This just might be my real, grand masterpiece. :)
