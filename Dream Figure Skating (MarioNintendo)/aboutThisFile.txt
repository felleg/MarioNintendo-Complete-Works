A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

This is a file Macgravel ASKED me to step for Video Game MegaPack 4. Literally, the song fell on my lap! I
couldn't disappoint him, so I stepped it. I didn't expect him to use the song as an easter egg for the pack...
If you don't know what I'm talking about, download Video Game MegaPack 4 and play the file on Stepmania 5 /
Etterna with backgrounds on. You will be mindblown by what happens at the end :)
