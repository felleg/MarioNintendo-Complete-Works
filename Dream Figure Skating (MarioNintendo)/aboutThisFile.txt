A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

This is a file Macgravel ASKED me to step for Video Game MegaPack 4. Literally, the song fell on my lap! I
couldn't disappoint him, so I stepped it. It was originally named "Dream Figure Skating" (due to its source
being Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games), but has since been renamed "Ending Theme".

I didn't expect Macgravel to use the song as the ending theme for the pack, let alone as an easter egg...  If
you don't know what I'm talking about, download Video Game MegaPack 4 and play the file on Stepmania 5 /
Etterna with backgrounds on. You will be mindblown by what happens at the end :)
