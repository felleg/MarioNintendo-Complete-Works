My 23th file on FFR.

Upon discovering this masterpiece by KgZ, I couldn't even understand why it wasn't stepped yet. It was an incredible piece, perfectly suited for FFR. I have to be honest; I really love this chart. It's one of my favorites. My weakness being layering in stepping, I think I really did a great job with how I handled this one. It's just so fun! And, as a special bonus, it has 777 arrows, something I totally didn't expect while I was stepping it!
