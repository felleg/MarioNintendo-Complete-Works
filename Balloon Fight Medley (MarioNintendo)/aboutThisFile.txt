A file I stepped 2016 for the Video Game MegaPack 4.

It had always been my dream to step for one of the Video Game MegaPacks, being a fan of the first 3 entries.
When the fourth pack was announced, I dived and stepped more files that year than the total number of files I
had previously completed at that point. It was the peak of my stepping career.

While the submissions for Video Game MegaPack 4 were open, it was right around the time Super Smash Brothers
for Wii U came out. I thought a ton of songs would fit in StepMania! I even fantasized stepping the entire OST
of Smash Wii U and release it as a standalone pack.

While this idea never happened, I'm glad I stepped this one. I think the layering is just right.
