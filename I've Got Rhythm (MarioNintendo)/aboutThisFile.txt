This song was created for the Piano Minipack of Elegance 2: http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/vbz/showthread.php?p=4664076
When I was stepping, I could have never guessed that Wayward Vagabond's computer would die, prompting me to
salvage the pack completely. I hope you guys enjoyed the pack!

This song is just a bit too hard for my own skills, but I find it so fun. Hiromi is so playful when she
plays... I hope you will have fun too. :)
