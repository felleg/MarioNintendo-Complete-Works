This file was stepped during Anime North 2018. It is my first true pad file. And oh boy, I totally
underestimated the difficulty, there's no way in hell I can pass this!

I was made aware of this song when Sanzath sent it my way. You see, I live in Quebec, and Anime North happens
in Toronto. To get there, we have to embark on a huge road trip. Naturally, road atrips are better with
soundtracks! I started this tradition in 2014 and we have made soundtracks every year ever since.

This song was too good not to be stepped. I ended up spending at least a good quarter of the convention on
this file. It was really exciting. I even have videos of people trying it out:

Enjoy! Don't be ashamed if you play the file with a keyboard. :)
